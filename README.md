This is a network-based, distributed card game engine. It will initially
support 4-person pinochle game, but I will attempt to make it modular and
generic where possible.

Thanks to Andy Lewis for working with me to better understand how brySVG
works with the browser DOM and for taking my suggested enhancement to
brySVG.
